🔐 kpm-debugger-bypass
Bypass Android anti-debug protections using a lightweight KPM (KernelPatch Module).

This module intercepts access to key files like /proc/self/status and /proc/self/task/*/status, commonly used by apps to detect debuggers. With this, you can stay under the radar—even when LLDB is attached.

🚀 Usage
Load the module using APatch KPM Manager
👉 Follow the guide: https://apatch.dev/kpm-usage-guide.html#embed

Once loaded, view logs using:

sh

Edit
dmesg -w | grep "kpm-debugger-bypass"
